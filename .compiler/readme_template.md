# Cancer Molecular Profile

Tumor molecular profiles for various cancer types

## About

This cancer-molecular-profile repository lists tumor molecular profiles for various cancer types, including rare fractions.

We create the list of gene variants and biomarkers by referring to public databases as follows:

- COSMIC
- GDC Data Portal (TCGA)
- My Cancer Genome

To make the list more objective, we also referred to literature, especially comprehensive papers summarizing NGS analysis, searched by PubMed for each cancer type. We reflected these in the list of gene variants and biomarkers.

We define the following two sections as molecular profiles for each tumor type:

- Representative Gene Variants or Biomarkers: Present in almost all tumors of specified subtypes.
- Other Gene Variants or Biomarkers: Present or absent in some tumors of specified subtypes, but these markers are characteristic for subtypes.
