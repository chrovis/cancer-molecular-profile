# Cancer Molecular Profile

Tumor molecular profiles for various cancer types

## About

This cancer-molecular-profile repository lists tumor molecular profiles for various cancer types, including rare fractions.

We create the list of gene variants and biomarkers by referring to public databases as follows:

- COSMIC
- GDC Data Portal (TCGA)
- My Cancer Genome

To make the list more objective, we also referred to literature, especially comprehensive papers summarizing NGS analysis, searched by PubMed for each cancer type. We reflected these in the list of gene variants and biomarkers.

We define the following two sections as molecular profiles for each tumor type:

- `Representative Gene Variants or Biomarkers`: Frequently present in the  specified tumor type and significant for the specific molecular subtype of it
- `Other Gene Variants or Biomarkers`: Present in some of the specified tumor types and characterize the molecular subtype
